# number_guessing_game
Hi! welcome to my number guessing game

this program that I call number guessing game includes many things such as:~
ğŸ”¥loops: i used that to set fixed number of trials.
                 it's not a game if u don't feel pressure ğŸ˜‰.

ğŸ”¥conditionals: to give a score (high/low/correct). 

ğŸ”¥try except block: validates the input. only numeric entry allowed.
                    so that mischevious people can't type anything that they want ğŸ˜¤

ğŸ”¥random module: the computer generates a new number for us to guess using this module

this is my first repo here. i hope everyone likes it ğŸ˜„
